# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering - Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The model analyzes customer purchasing behavior and demographics to identify distinct customer groups, which can be valuable for targeted marketing strategies and business decision-making.

## About This Project
This is a Machine Learning project that implements K-Means clustering to perform customer segmentation. It uses a dataset of customer information to group similar customers together based on their characteristics.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Visualization of customer data
- Implementation of K-Means clustering algorithm
- Determination of optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method
- Detailed analysis of customer segments
- Interactive plots and visualizations

## Dataset
- The dataset (`Mall_Customers.csv`) contains customer demographic information
- Features include Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score
- This data helps identify different customer segments

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for implementing K-Means clustering
